# Your goal here is to make a program that prints out two variables with maths applied to them
# It should print the two variables with each basic maths tool in them, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

# So for example:
# v1 = 10
# v2 = 5
# print(v1 plus v2)
# print(v1 minus v2)
# ^^^ is not actual code, it's just an example


# Your code here:
####################

# Setup variables
var1 = 6
var2 = 4

# Define Function


# use the function (example: maths_function(var1, var2))
